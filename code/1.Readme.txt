This zip file contains three sub-files: Methods, Real_Data and Simulation

Methods: consists of all methods used in simulation and real-data analysis. 
- CAT: the proposed covariate-assisted multi-layer community detection
- JEG: Joint Graph Embedding method
- LSM: Least square estimation
- MAS: Spectral Aggregation

Real Data: consists of two sub-files: Business data and Citation Network.
- Business data: contains files about how we pre-process the original data and the codes for
getting stocks prices and the associated numerical experiments.

- Citation Network:  contains files of codes for how we pre-process the network data and 
the codes for the associated numerical experiments.

Simulation: consists of three simulation settings.

For each setting, Codes for reproducible experiments, how we present the results as in the paper, and
the result files in .npy are available.
